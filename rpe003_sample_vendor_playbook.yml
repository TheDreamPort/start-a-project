# file - rpe003_sample_vendor_playbook.yml
# ----------------------------------------
# use this playbook to setup your windows hosts with the items you need for your experiment. This assumes you have run
# list_computers.py to list all of the hosts in your domain. Those computers should be copied into your hosts file in 
# this dorectory.
#
# this playbook assumes a complete Windows environment!!!
#
# this has been written and tested on the following environments:
# - Ansible 2.7 Ubuntu 16.04.5, Python 2.7.15
# - Ansible 2.7 Ubuntu 18.04.1, Python 2.7.15rc1
#################
# MAKE SURE TO RUN list_computers.py before this:
# ./list_computers.py Administrator <PASSWORD> > hosts
#
# you should delete the Domain Controller, WDS and linux servers from this list though
#################
# the syntax to invoke this script is:
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=hosts windows_prep.yml --ask-pass -u Administrator
#
# As you can see, there are no passwords anywhere in this or ANY Ansible configuration file. They are mean to be supplied
# on the command line.
#################
# don't be alarmed if some hosts fail to be modified via ansible, 
# it simply means they were powered off...
